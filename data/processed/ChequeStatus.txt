Cheque Status
-----------------
You can enquire into the status of a particular cheque or that of all the cheques issued on an account.  The different status are:

Unpaid
Paid
Returned
Stopped

When you issue a cheque, it has the unpaid status. This status lasts till the cheque is paid or returned unpaid. 
A cheque returned unpaid , when subsequently paid, gains the status 'paid'.
