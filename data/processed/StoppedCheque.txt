Stopped Cheque
-------------------
You can stop the payment of an issued cheque or range of cheques. When you give the stop instruction, the system does these validations:

Do the cheques belong to the indicated account ?
Are they still 'unpaid' ?

You can capture  the following information while stopping a cheque :

Cheque Number  
Currency & Amount
Date
Benefuciary's Name

You can capture  the following information while stopping a series of cheques:

Cheque Begin Number
Cheque End Number


The system produces an acknowledgement to the customer informing the recording of stop instruction at EoD.

You can view the stop instructions of a particular account or all the stop instructions held by the system.

You can revoke a stop instruction whenever you want.
