Cheque Management

Bankfair allows issue of cheques to customers on transaction accounts. Cheques cannot be issued on fixed or instalment accounts. When a debit is made through cheques, the transaction mechanism ensures that 

    • the cheque number pertain to the concerned  account
    •  it is not already paid and 
    •  the payment of the cheque has not been stopped.
